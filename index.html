<h2>Print Media</h2>

<h3>House Plant Handbook</h3>
<p>
This was a school assignment to create an informative book on a subject of our choosing. I had to research the subject, illustrate the images, design the layout of the booklet, and print and assemble the physical copy. The booklet in its entirety can be seen <a href="images/art/1001.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>No Poverty Campaign and Magazine Spread</h3>
<p>
This was a school project about the UN’s Global Action Goals. The goal I chose to focus on was poverty. Everyone in the class created a magazine spread with infographics, and they were all compiled into a single magazine. For the second half of the project, we had to create an infographic ad campaign. Both the magazine and the ad campaign can be seen <a href="images/print/Binder1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>DomoDeco Custom Font Poster</h3>
<p>
This was a school project where we created a custom font of our choosing and had to produce a number of printed accompaniments. I'm particularly fond of the final part of the project, which involved creating a poster. The poster is double-sided and can be displayed horizontally or vertically depending on which side is up. I used FontLab 8 to create the font, InDesign for the layout, and ZBrush to model the silver mask. The poster can be seen <a href="images/print/poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>


<h2>Websites</h2>

<h3>Book Suggester Website</h3>
<p>
A project I completed in the second half of second year at OCADU. It is a book-suggestion quiz based on the books I read that year. It works on both mobile and desktop, but I prefer the mobile layout. It can be seen <a href="https://rivercarley.github.io/quiz/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Lecture Series WebPoster</h3>
<p>
A project I completed in the second half of second year at OCADU. It's an interactive poster for a lecture series in the class <em>Research Methods for Graphic Design</em>. One of the main requirements was ensuring it adapted fluidly to all screen sizes and orientations. It can be seen <a href="https://rivercarley.github.io/posterthree/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2>Logos</h2>
<div class="grid-container3">
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/logos/Artboard 1.png" alt="Image 1" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/logos/1 (6).png" alt="Image 2" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/logos/crest+text revisons .png" alt="Image 3" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
</div>

<p>These are all freelance projects I completed while in school.</p>

<p>
<strong>StoryMode</strong> — The left-most logo was designed for a video-game-inspired clothing brand. This project went through many iterations—this is one of about twenty final versions. The challenge was creating a design that read as “video game” without infringing on existing intellectual property.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bright Black</strong> — A furniture refinishing company that paints pieces in bright colours and applies a black wash so that just a hint of the colour shows through. The challenge was communicating the craftsperson's technique visually within the logo.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Aureole</strong> — A video editing service. This project was challenging because the client had a very clear idea, along with a detailed 3D AI-generated image they wanted interpreted as a logo. I feel this logo could still be improved, as it has functional issues in terms of detail and contrast.
</p>


<h2>Collection of Artwork</h2>

<div class="grid-container4">
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/art/1ff.png" alt="Image 1" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/art/2ff.png" alt="Image 2" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/art/3ff.png" alt="Image 3" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
  <div class="grid-item"><img src="images/art/f10.png" alt="Image 4" onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
</div>

<p> This is just a collection of art work I have done. It was hard to keep it to just a few because I do so many, but this is a sampler of some of the styles I work in during my freetime.</p>
