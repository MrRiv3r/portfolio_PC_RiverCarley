      <h3>House Plant Handbook</h3>
  

      <p>This was a school assignment to create an informative book on a subject of our choosing. I hjad to reaseach the subject, illustrate the images, do the layout and design of the book let , and print and assemble the physical book. The booklet in its entirety can be seen  <a href="images/art/1001.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
      
      <h3>No Poverty Campaign and magazine spread</h3>
   
      <p>This was a school project about the UN's Global Action goals. The goal I chose to focus on was poverty. Everyone in the class created a magazine spread with info graphics and they all were compiled into a magazine. For the second half of the project we had to create an infograpoohic ad campaign. Both the magazinbe and the ad campaign can be seen <a href="images/print/Binder1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <h3>DomoDeco custome font poster</h3>

      <p>This was a school project where we created a custome font of our choosing and had to create a number of printed acompanyment. Im preticularly fond of the final leg of the project which was creating a poster. The poster is double sided and depending on the side you put up it can be either horizontal or vertical. i used fontLab8 to make the font, indesign to make the layout, and zBrush to make the silver mask. The poster can be seen <a href="images/print/poster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

<h2>WebSites</h2>

      <h3>Book Suggester website</h3>
      <p>A project I completed in the second half of second year at OCADU. It is a book suggestion quiz based on the books I read that year. It works on mobile and browser, but I prefer mobile. it can be seen <a href="https://rivercarley.github.io/quiz/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
       <h3>Lecture series WebPoster</h3>
      <p>A project I completed in the second half of second year at OCADU. It's an interactive poster for a lecture series in the class Research Methods for Graphic Design. One of the main features of the website and requirements for the project was to make it work on all screen sizes and orientations and change the layout based on screen size. It can be seen <a href="https://rivercarley.github.io/posterthree/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

      <h2>Logos</h2>
      <div class="grid-container3">
        <div class="grid-item">  <img src="images/logos/Artboard 1.png" alt="Image 1"onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
        <div class="grid-item"> <img src="images/logos/1 (6).png" alt="Image 2"onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
        <div class="grid-item">  <img src="images/logos/crest+text revisons .png" alt="Image 3"onclick="openPopup(this.src)"></div>
      </div>
      <p>These are all freelance projects I did while in school.</p>
      <p>StoryMode the left most logo was a video game inspirted logo for a clothing brand. This project went through many irterations and this is just one of about 20 final verison. the challanges were making the logo affiliated with video games without bordering on other peoples intelectual property.</p>
      <p>Bright Black is a furneture refinsihing company, that paints a peice bright colors and then applies a wash of black over the color so just a hit of the color shows through. The challanges on this project was trying to communicate the technique the craft person used in logo form</p>
      <p>Aureole is a video editing service. This job was tricky becuase the customer had a very clear idea of what they wanted and a very detialed 3D AI image they wanted translated into a logo. I think this one could be a lot better and has some functional problems as a logo as far as level ofg detial and contrast</p>


<h2>Collection of ArtWork</h2>
    <h3>Imagination Collection</h3>

      </div>
      <p>This is a collection I made in my free time based around the visual representation of the cognitive sensation and phenomenon of imagination. I wanted to show the idea of how creative ideas are formed in three different styles. The right most image is about the crystallization of an idea and done in a realistic style in Corel Painter. The center image is about how the mind stretches to accommodate new ideas. It is done in a surrealistic style with PhotoShop. The left most image is about how the mind travels on a current when imagining and is directed by outside forces and I represented the mind as an abstract leaf on the wind or water. It's done with more traditional mediums of marker and pen. The left most is my favourite of the three because it looks like a lot of different things when rotated.</p>
